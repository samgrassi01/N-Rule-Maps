    "# N-Rule Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present notebook we provide example use of the work provided in the local `n_rule_maps.py` file, that applies specified n-rule maps to a specified space of intersecting lines in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.  See the following notes for brief background into n-rule maps and code documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "Here we breifly discuss the notion of n-rule maps.  For rigorous introduction please see the paper *On N-Rule Maps* by Grassi, or the paper *A Piecewise Contractive Map on Triangles* by Grassi for rigorous discussion of the simple \"perpindicular projection map\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We will label the space $X_m$ as the space of $m$ pairwise nonparallel, nonconcurrent lines in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.  An **n-rule map** is generally described as a sequential composition of piecewise mappings over the space $X_m$, where we call each such mapping a **rule**, and an n-rule map may then defined as a **rule sequence**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we denote each rule as a 3-tuple of form $(A, O, D)$, where $A$ is an angle chosen from the half-open interval $(0, \\pi/2]$, $O$ is an *orientation* choice chosen to be either $0$ or $1$, and $D$ is a positive integer in the range $1 \\leq D \\leq m$ and labels a mapping *distance* choice.  Each rule then acts over the space $X_m$ as follows.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ be a point in $X_m$, and let $r(x)$ denote the application of rule $r \\equiv (A, O, D)$ over the point $x$. The action of $r$ over $x$ is then a mapping action from $x$ to some other point $y$ in $X_m$.  The distance option $D$ in $r$ specifies the line $r$ will map to from $x$; if $D=1$, $r$ will map to the line closest to $x$, if $D=2$ $r$ will map to the second closest line to $x$, and so on so that if $D=m$, $r$ maps to the farthest line in $X_m$ from $x$.  Once a line to map to has been identified, construct the two lines that intersect with the target line at angle $A$, and pass through the point $x$.  The orientation then  specifies a binary choice between one of these two lines.  For more detailed description see the *On N-Rule Maps* paper.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An n-rule map, labeled $K_n$, is then defined as a sequential composition of $n$ such rules over an initial point $x_0$, where sequential iteration of $K_n$ continuously loops through the $n$ rules in the rule sequence defining $K_n$.  That is, notationally, $K_n \\equiv r_1r_2r_3...r_n$, and $K_n(x_0) = r_1(x_0)$ and $K_n^k(x_0) = r_i(x_0)$ where here $i = (k \\mod n)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main result we are concerned with, is that for any space $X_m$ and n-rule map $K_n$, sequential iteration of $K_n$ over an initial point in $X_m$ will either diverge or converge to a periodic orbit.  The program provided here allows for experimental implementation of specified n-rule maps over specified spaces $X_m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark on fixed points**.  Formally, there will exist multiple points in any space $X_m$ in which the distance from one such point to two or more lines is the same.  In such cases we will call the points *fixed*, and deal with them with accordingly (see *On N-Rule Maps*).  The present software however does not currently identify fixed points and treat them any differently from non-fixed points.  In almost all cases this is harmless, however until such functionality has been implemented the user should be aware.\n",

    "## Code Documentation\n",
    "This software requires Python 3.x, NumPy, and Matplotlib.  \n",
    "### Basic use\n",
    "To use the n-rule maps software in a general setting, take the `n_rule_maps.py` file and import it into the program.  To then use the software call the `nRuleMap` function that returns the n-rule map orbit as a list, and plots the orbit generated by the specified n-rule map in the specified space.  See the following block for function form and docstring.\n",
    "```\n",
    "nRuleMap(X_m, nrule, num_iter, points_to_plot, start_point, orbit_color=\"red\"):\n",

    "    in the specified space X_m.  If the n-rule map converges to a periodic orbit\n",
    "    within num_iter iterations, the program will return the period.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Inputs:\n",
    "    X_m: input a list of m tuples, where m is the number of lines plus the x axis, so \n",
    "        X_m is of form [(slope1, intercept1), (slope2, intercept2), ...] for line slope and intercept\n",
    "        where line slope is an angle in degrees.  Further, we require that len(X_m) >= 2, as the x-axis \n",

    "See the below code blocks for multiple examples of n-rule maps over different spaces.  Importantly recall that for each line specified in the `X_m` input of form `(slope, intercept)`, the slope argument is an *angle* in degrees, so the input `(45, 1)` corresponds with the line $y=x+1$.  Further, this program takes the $x$ axis to always be a line in the space, so specifying $m$ lines will give a space $X_{m+1}$.\n",

    "### Errors & Currently Known Bugs\n",
    "**Assertion Errors:** If an assertion error is thrown, then either too few lines were specified, or one or more of the rule in the given n-rule map have illegal arguments.  Ensure that for each given rule, the angle is in degrees and between 0 and 90, not including 0, that the orientation value is either 0 or 1, and that the distance parameter is a positive integer in the range $[1, m]$ where $m$ is the number of lines given.  For example, if the user inputs 3 lines, a legal rule is `(60.04, 0, 3)`, and an illegal rule is `(91, 3, 6.5)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**List index out of range errors:** At the present moment the code used to determine the period of an orbit is incredibly unstable, and will throw a `List index out of range` error if no period was found.  To resolve such errors, it is best to increase the number of iterations so that the map has opportunity to converge to an orbit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect periods:** As previously mentioned the code used to determine a period of an orbit is unstable, and will return incorrect periods.  Example includes when the orbit diverges in the space, and the code will still return a period.  We are currently working on rectifying such issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orbits mapping to incorrect points** Although the code used to generate orbits is generally stable, there are occasional bugs where orbits will appear that do not map to one of the specified lines.  Such errors are relatively uncommon, however we are working on fixing these as well."
